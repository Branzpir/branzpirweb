			<h3>TERMS & CONDITIONS OF BUSINESS WITH BRANZPIR:</h3>
			<br><h4>GENERAL</h4>
			These Terms and Conditions (“Conditions”) apply to all contracts between Adroitt Group Pty Ltd as Branzpir (“Branzpir”) and the purchaser (“Purchaser”) of any goods, products or materials (“Goods”) supplied by Branzpir on credit (if sold or supplied on credit) or otherwise (“Contract”).
			These Conditions will prevail over any terms, conditions, representations or understandings between the Purchaser and Branzpir in relation to the Goods, whether or not any inconsistency arises.
			Branzpir expressly rejects any conditional order made by a Purchaser.
			A contract is formed when Branzpir receives any purchase order and either sends a written acceptance to the Purchaser or dispatches the Goods pursuant to the order.
			<h4>QUOTATIONS</h4>
			Quotations are valid for thirty (30) days unless otherwise stated by Branzpir and may be withdrawn, revoked or varied at any time.
			Quotations are not to be construed as an offer or obligation to sell and are provided to the Purchaser for purpose of providing estimates only.
			<h4>ORDERS AND PRICES</h4>
			Branzpir reserves the right to accept or decline, in whole or in part, any order for Goods or Services placed by the Purchaser.
			Branzpir is under no obligation to accept orders less than $75.00 (seventy five dollars).
			Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, orders received for out of stock Goods will be placed on back order. All backorders will be charged at the price prevailing at the time of the original order. Branzpir will not be liable for any loss or damage that the Purchaser may suffer in connection with Goods being out of stock.
			Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, all backorders will be delivered in accordance with Branzpir’s standard delivery terms in clauses 14-17.
			Unless otherwise stated, all prices for Goods are exclusive of all applicable taxes and charges. Where the Goods sold are subject to GST, the Purchaser is liable to pay any applicable amount of GST at the same time as payment for Goods is made.
			The prices and product specifications contained in Branzpir’s price lists or any information provided by Branzpir to the Purchaser are subject to change at the absolute discretion of Branzpir and without notice to the Purchaser.
			Unless agreed otherwise, prices quoted include Branzpir’s standard packing arrangements.
			<h4>DELIVERY</h4>
			All orders are subject to delivery fees payable by the Purchaser.
			Branzpir will endeavour to dispatch all standard orders as soon as practicable, however it will not be responsible for any loss or damage associated with Goods being dispatched late.
			Any time or date named and accepted by Branzpir for completion, delivery and despatch is an estimate only and does not constitute a representation, or term of the contract, nor shall it be part of the description of the Goods and is not of the essence of the contract.
			Branzpir is deemed to have delivered the Goods when collected by the Purchaser or when they are made available for unloading at the Purchaser’s nominated delivery point (whichever occurs first).
			<h4>PAYMENT</h4>
			Payment for Goods purchased from Branzpir is of the essence and must be made by the Purchaser in accordance with the invoice issued by Branzpir or by other agreement such as immediately prior to delivery of the Goods or cash on delivery. Branzpir may also require a deposit at any time.
			Where the Purchaser has an approved credit account with Branzpir, the Purchaser must ensure that payment for the Goods is made within 7 days after the date of Branzpir’s invoice or such other date for payment as Branzpir and the Purchaser agree in writing.
			Branzpir, at its absolute discretion, may refuse delivery of the Goods and acceptance of any other orders from the Purchaser until the Purchaser pays to Branzpir any amounts owed or contingently owed for any reason whatsoever by the Purchaser to Branzpir whether under this or any contract or otherwise.
			Branzpir reserves the right to charge interest on any outstanding amount from the date it becomes outstanding for payment to the date payment is received at the rate of 6% per month compounded daily. All payments made by the Purchaser will first be applied to the accrued interest.
			Payments made by credit card may be subject to a surcharge.
			<h4>RISK AND RETENTION OF TITLE</h4>
			Unless otherwise provided in these Conditions, the Goods supplied by Branzpir to the Purchaser shall be at the Purchaser’s sole risk immediately upon their delivery to the Purchaser.
			The Purchaser agrees that title to Goods is retained by Branzpir until Branzpir receives from the Purchaser:
			a.       payment in full for the purchased Goods; and
			b.       all other monies owing by the Purchaser to Branzpir at any time.
			Where the Goods comprise a number of items, the property of Branzpir in each item comprising the Goods will not pass to the Purchaser for any individual item until payment in full is received for all items.
			Prior to title in the Goods passing to the Purchaser, the Purchaser agrees that:
			a.       it acts as bailee of the Goods until such time as property in them passes to the Purchaser and that this bailment continues for each item of the Goods until the price has been paid in full;
			b.       it must keep the Goods in good and merchantable condition and fully insure the Goods against loss or damage however caused;
			c.       it must not sell the Goods except with the prior written consent of Branzpir or in the ordinary course of the Purchaser’s business, provided that any such sale is at arms’ length and on market terms;
			d.       any proceeds of re-sale, insofar as they relate to the Goods shall be held on trust for Branzpir in a separate account; and
			e.       it must not create any encumbrance over the Goods which is inconsistent with Branzpir’s title and ownership of the Goods.
			<h4>SPECIFICATIONS, MEASUREMENTS AND MATERIAL</h4>
			All descriptions, specifications, illustrations, drawings, data, dimensions and weights contained in catalogues, price lists or other advertising material of Branzpir or elsewhere are approximations only. They are intended by Branzpir to be a general description for information and identification purposes and do not create a sale by description.
			Any plans, specifications, measurements, information or any material of any nature whatsoever provided to Branzpir by the Purchaser for the purposes of fulfilling an order (“Material”) is deemed to be accurate and fit for purpose. Branzpir will not be liable for any loss arising out of the supply of the Material provided to Branzpir by the Purchaser.
			Branzpir reserves the right to refuse to use any Purchaser supplied Material if it deems such material inappropriate for its processes.
			<h4>RETURNS AND CANCELLATIONS</h4>
			Branzpir cannot accept returns of custom-made or specially produced Goods.
			Any cancelled orders will result in the Purchaser being liable for the greater of any costs incurred by Branzpir or 25% of the order price.
			Except as provided otherwise by the ACL, returns of all other Goods are subject to prior approval of Branzpir at its absolute discretion upon a written request by the Purchaser made within 14 calendar days from the date of delivery. Goods must be unused, undamaged and in their original packaging.
			All credit for Goods that have been approved for return will incur a restocking fee of 20% of the invoiced value of the returned Goods. The Purchaser must bear any costs associated with the return of Goods.
			<h4>INACCURACIES</h4>
			The Purchaser must check all Goods received as soon as they are delivered and must notify Branzpir in writing of any inaccuracies or short supply of Goods or any fault, damage or defect in Goods within 7 Calendar days of the date of delivery of the Goods.
			If the Purchaser notifies Branzpir under clause 34, Branzpir may at its election in its sole discretion replace or give a credit for the Goods.
			If the Purchaser does not notify Branzpir in writing within 7 calendar days of the date of delivery, Branzpir will not be responsible for any loss or damage arising out of or resulting from such inaccuracies or short supply of Goods, or fault, damage or defect in Goods.
			The Purchaser will be deemed to have accepted the Goods after 7 calendar days from the date of receipt of the Goods, unless within that time the Purchaser has notified Branzpir under clause 34.
			<h4>WARRANTY AND LIABILITY</h4>
			Branzpir acknowledges that where the ACL applies with respect to Goods, certain guarantees and rights are provided by the CCA and ACL.
			Where the ACL applies with respect to any supply of Goods to the Purchaser:
			a.       any rights provided to the Purchaser by the ACL or CCA that by statute cannot be excluded that are inconsistent with any term of these Conditions are to prevail over any terms of these Conditions to the extent of the inconsistency;
			b.       nothing in these Conditions purports to derogate from or exclude any rights provided by the ACL or CCA that by statute cannot be excluded or modified.
			Branzpir makes no express warranties or representations in relation to the Goods supplied by it.
			Branzpir will not be responsible in any way whatsoever for the consequence of any representation or conduct made or technical advice given in connection with the Goods whether by its employees, agents or sub-contractors or otherwise to the Purchaser or any third parties.

			Subject to clause 39, to the extent permitted by statute, all warranties, conditions and guarantees (whether express, implied or applied, and whether given by Branzpir, the manufacturer or a third party) pertaining to or in connection with the Goods and any obligation of Branzpir to repair or replace any Goods are excluded.
			<h4>INDEMNITY</h4>

			a.       as a result of the Purchaser’s failure to comply with any laws, rules, standards or regulations applicable in relation to the Goods or the use of the Goods;
			b.       as a result of any other negligence or other breach of duty by the Purchaser’s in connection with the Goods; and/or
			c.       as a result any breach of these Conditions by the Purchaser.
